# skyzip
An app that plays with zipcodes and weather (early stages)

This app will use the zipcodeAPI and the openWeatherMapAPI to display a customized representational image of the zipcode's weather and environment.

Users will be able to create unique icons of the weather, time of day, and terrain of an environment in the US (and presumable the world)
